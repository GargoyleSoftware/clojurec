* Compiler
** TODO Use C arrays for rest arguments
Allocate them on the stack where possible.
** TODO Use the namespaces atom for protocols, too
** TODO Dot in deftype constructor names
** TODO Don't depend on C argument evaluation order
Argument evaluation order in C is undefined.  This will probably
eventually bite us in more than one place.  The compiler will have to
transform complex expressions into simple C statements, like

  (a (b) (c))

into

  tmp1 = b ();
  tmp2 = c ();
  return a (tmp1, tmp2);

This will require rewriting the emitter a bit.  It will also help
getting rid of a few areas where we now output awkward code.
** TODO Don't construct constants anew every time they're evaluated
Best to generate them at first evaluation, then store them in a static
var.
* Runtime
